# Project 1: Understanding Basic Linux Process Monitoring

This project has been instrumental in helping me understand the fundamentals of Linux process monitoring. Through hands-on experience, I have learned to use several essential commands that are crucial for system administration and performance tuning.

## Key Learnings

### Process Monitoring Commands

- **top**: This command provides a dynamic, real-time view of the running system. It displays system summary information and a list of tasks currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
- **ps**: The `ps` command is used to display information about active processes. It provides a snapshot of the current processes along with details such as PID, TTY, time, and command name.
- **free**: This command shows the amount of free and used memory in the system. It provides a quick overview of the system's memory usage, including physical memory, swap memory, and buffers.
- **df**: The `df` command reports the amount of disk space used and available on file systems. It is useful for monitoring disk usage and ensuring that there is enough space for applications to run smoothly.

### Text Processing and Formatting

- **sed**: The Stream Editor (`sed`) is a powerful tool for parsing and transforming text. It is commonly used for text substitution, deletion, and insertion in files.
- **awk**: The `awk` command is a versatile programming language for working on files. It is used for pattern scanning and processing, allowing for complex text manipulations and data extraction.

## Conclusion

By working on this project, I have gained a solid understanding of basic Linux process monitoring and text processing commands. These skills are essential for effective system administration and will be invaluable in my future projects.
