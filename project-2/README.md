# Project 2: Log Archive Tool

As part of the SRE roadmap, I've completed [Project 2: Log Archive Tool](https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool). In this project, I learned how to build a CLI tool in Python, gaining knowledge about the `typer`, `subprocess`, and `os` modules. Additionally, I learned how to create and package an executable CLI tool with `pyproject.toml`.

## Key Features

- **CLI Tool**: Developed a command-line interface tool using Python.
- **Modules Used**: Utilized `typer` for CLI creation, `subprocess` for executing shell commands, and `os` for interacting with the operating system.
- **Packaging**: Learned to package the tool as an executable using `pyproject.toml`.

## Installation

To install the Log Archive Tool, clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the tool by running:

```bash
log-archive-tool --help
```

This will display all available commands and options.

## Lessons Learned

- **Python CLI Development**: Gained experience in building and packaging Python CLI tools.
- **Module Integration**: Learned to integrate various Python modules to create a functional tool.
- **Executable Packaging**: Understood the process of packaging Python scripts into executable tools.
