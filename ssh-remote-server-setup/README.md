# SSH Remote Server Setup

In this project, I created an AWS EC2 instance and learned a bit about AWS. I generated two SSH key pairs: one using RSA and the other using ECDSA. I then set up the SSH keys on the EC2 instance and created a configuration in the `~/.ssh/config` file on my local machine, allowing me to `ssh instance` directly into the EC2 instance.

## Key Learnings

- **AWS EC2**: Understanding the basics of AWS and how to create and manage EC2 instances.
- **SSH Key Pairs**: Generating and using RSA and ECDSA key pairs for secure access.
- **SSH Configuration**: Setting up the `~/.ssh/config` file for simplified SSH access.
- **Networking Protocols**:
    - **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    - **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP
    - **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol
    - **SSH**: Secure Shell
    - **SFTP**: SSH File Transfer Protocol
    - **TLS**: Transport Layer Security

These protocols are essential for secure and efficient communication over networks.
