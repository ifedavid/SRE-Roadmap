# SRE Roadmap - Static Site Server

## Project Overview

For this project - [Static Site Server](https://roadmap.sh/projects/static-site-server), I learned about starting and configuring an Nginx server. I was able to configure and start one and serve this static website. I loaded it on the browser with my AWS EC2 instance public IP.

## Key Learnings

- **Nginx Server**: Configured and started an Nginx server to serve a static website.
- **AWS EC2**: Deployed the static site using the public IP of an AWS EC2 instance.
- **File Synchronization**: Utilized `rsync` to sync files between a local and remote server.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Nginx**
- **AWS EC2**
- **rsync**
